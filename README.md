#[Micro](micro.mu) Training for Go Webservices

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/bennythejudge/microclass.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

To view the slides locally, install Go's `present` tool:

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

Then change into this directory and type `present`.  Slides will be available on http://127.0.0.1:3999

This course includes 7 modules.  Each module has a slide or series of slides and a set of example code.

There are bash scripts to start docker containers for dependent services (like databases) where necessary.
